## Problem 14 (Linear Filter)

### 1. *In what sense is a linear filter linear?*

### 2. 

### 3. What is the advantage of a causal filter over a non- causal filter

- Causal filters have real- time applications while non- causal filters cannot be observed using real data.

- Non- causal filters possibly use data from future time periods which are not observable. 

## Problem 15 ()


## Problem 17 

```{r}
df <- read.table(file = "Transport.txt")

plot(y =  df$V1,  x = seq(1, length(df$V1)), type = "l")
index <- seq(1:length(df$V1))


df <- cbind(df, index)
```

```{r}
hist(df$V1)
spectrum(df$V1)
qqnorm(df$V1, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(df$V1, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)
```
